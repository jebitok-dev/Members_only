# Exclusive-Clubhouse(Members-Only)

![screenshot](./app/assets/images/clubhse1.png)

This project puts your knowledge of authentication, sessions and cookies as well as forms, models, controllers, and validations to the tests. The aim of the project is to build a Exclusive Clubhouse that allows users to see the identity of authors of posts but outsiders just view stories but authors remain anonymous, using devise and Rails methods/helpers.

## Built With

- Ruby -v 2.7.0
- Rails -v 6.1.1
- Live-Reloader
- Bulma(CSS)
- SQLite3
- Devise
- Guard
